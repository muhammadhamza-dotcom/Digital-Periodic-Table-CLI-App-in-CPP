# Digital-Periodic-Table-CLI-App-in-CPP
An app that lets you search for any element in the periodic table by its atomic number, symbol, and name, you can even search for different types of elements separately such as halogens, etc. Well, you must be wondering if I can view the Periodic Table separately and yes you can do that too. That's it? well no to top it off I thought it would be fun to add a game to it. It's a memory game to help you memorize the elements and yes all of this in a CLI app. Have fun with it ;).
